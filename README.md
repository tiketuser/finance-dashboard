# Finance Dashboard

Finance Dashboard is a Next.js app designed for Israeli investors who want clearer, plain-language explanations of stock data. Beyond showing fundamentals (e.g., P/E, profitability, valuation), the app defines each metric, compares it to peers, and lets you ask follow-up questions so the meaning of every number is obvious before making a decision.

## What it does
- Displays company data and key ratios with context, not just numbers.
- Provides definitions and AI guidance (e.g., whether a P/E of 23 is expensive or cheap for the sector).
- Supports follow-up questions so you can get a clearer explanation without leaving the page.

## Folder structure
- `app/` – Next.js App Router pages, layout, and global styles.
- `component/` – Placeholder for shared UI components.
- `public/` – Static assets (icons, logos, SVGs).
- `*.config.*` – Project configuration (Next.js, ESLint, PostCSS, TypeScript).

## Getting started
Install dependencies and run the dev server:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
Then open http://localhost:3000.
